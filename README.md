# raw_to_jpeg
Python script to convert any RAW (supported by rawpy) to JPEG

## usage
`python raw2jpeg.py <Raw_Img>`

RAW_Img can be `.ARW, .DNG, .CR2`

## note
It just saves the thumbnail embedded.<br>but is a good enough solution if you only have a RAW

for more raw img experiments you can see the `raw_viewer.ipynb`

## dependencies
`pip install rawpy`
